    "Gelman et al. (2013) describe the process of conducting Bayesian statistical analysis in 3 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Specify a probability model\n",
    "\n",
    "As was noted above, Bayesian statistics involves using probability models to solve problems. So, the first task is to *completely specify* the model in terms of probability distributions. This includes everything: unknown parameters, data, covariates, missing data, predictions. All must be assigned some probability density.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why posterior? Because it tells us what we know about the unknown \\\\(\\theta\\\\) *after* having observed \\\\(y\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "This posterior distribution is formulated as a function of the probability model that was specified in Step 1. Usually, we can write it down but we cannot calculate it analytically. In fact, the difficulty inherent in calculating the posterior distribution for most models of interest is perhaps the major contributing factor for the lack of widespread adoption of Bayesian methods for data analysis. Various strategies for doing so comprise this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But**, once the posterior distribution is calculated, you get a lot for free:\n",
    "\n",
    "- point estimates\n",

    "- predictions\n",

    "### Step 3: Check your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Though frequently ignored in practice, it is critical that the model and its outputs be assessed before using the outputs for inference. Models are specified based on assumptions that are largely unverifiable, so the least we can do is examine the output in detail, relative to the specified model and the data that were used to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we must ask:\n",

In comparison, most frequentist inference procedures violate the likelihood principle, because inference will depend on the design of the trial or experiment.\n",

    "which, when log-transformed, becomes:\n",

Here, we will use the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm that is provided by SciPy's `fmin_bfgs` function. In addition to returning an estimate of the mode, it returns the estimated variance-covariance matrix, which we will need to parameterize the multivariate normal distribution.\n",

Specifically, the **importance sampling estimate** of $E[h(\\theta) | y]$ is:\n",
